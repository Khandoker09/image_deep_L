# Emotion Detection From Image
This is a very simple app to detect human emotion from the image. A simple deep learning convolutional network was trained over 10100 images of people with sad and happy faces. This model was used in the background of this app. This model can only predict two emtion of human either happy or sad, so its a binary classifier.
